# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the yearly temperatures of Hawaii and answer the following questions:  
* Are there significant differences in the weather between the summer and winter? 
* And is it a good idea to open a surfboards and ice cream business in Hawaii given the weather throughout the year? 

## Results

Based on the results of the analysis, I conclude the following: 
* Hawaii is fairly warm throughout the year; the average temperature is 23.9 degrees Celsius in June and 21.7 degrees Celsius in December. 
* There are no significantly large differences between the summers and winters in Hawaii in terms of the average temperature and maximum temperature.
* The lowest temperature recorded in the winter is jacket-wearing weather (13.3 degrees Celsius in Dec vs. 17.8 degrees Celsius in June) so I predict the business to perform better in the summers than during the winters.

## Summary 

Hawaii has a fairly warm climate throughout the year. It appears that opening a surfboard and ice cream business in Hawaii would be a good idea because there's good weather for both throughout the year. 

There are some other factors that may impact the amount of surfing that people want to do and the amount of ice cream they may want to eat. Additional queries that can be performed to gain more insights include analyzing the differences in precipitation and sun and cloud cover throughout the year.
